            THESE PROGRAMS ARE WRITTENED IN PYTHON. SO YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD AND
            INSTALL THE PROGRAM NAMED "IDLE" ON YOUR OPERATING SYSTEM AT
            <a href="https://www.python.org"> PYTHON.ORG</a> TO RUN THEM. IF
            YOUR COMPUTER RUNS macOS OR Linux, YOU MIGHT ALREADY HAVE AN IDLE
            VERSION ON YOUR COMPUTER, BUT IT IS MAYBE OLD. IF YOU ARE ON
            Windows, YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL AN IDLE VERSION.</strong

      Here there is a little game that I've imagined called "the chain game"
      because the goal is to find a word who have the same caracters number like
      the printed word. This game is in French.
